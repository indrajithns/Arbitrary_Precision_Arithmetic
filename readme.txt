Arbitrary Precision Arithmetic

This project implements an application for arbitrary precision arithmetic, capable of performing basic arithmetic operations on large numbers using doubly linked lists.

Features

- Perform arithmetic operations on large numbers:
  - Addition (+)
  - Subtraction (-)
  - Multiplication (*)
  - Division (/)
  - Modulus (%)
- Supports user input in the form of large numbers (e.g., 123456789012345+67890).
- Handles operations using doubly linked lists for efficient number representation.
- Includes input validation and error handling for invalid operations and division/modulus by zero.
- Allows the user to perform multiple calculations in a single session.

Usage

Compilation

Use the following command to compile the program:

>> make


Running the Application
